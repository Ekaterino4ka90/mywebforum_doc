# Export

There are several reasons why exporting data from a website may be necessary:

- **_Data Backup:_** Exporting data from a website can serve as a backup measure to ensure that important information is preserved in case of data loss or website downtime. Having a copy of data in a different format or location can help safeguard against unexpected situations.
- **_Data Migration:_** When transitioning to a new website or a content management system, exporting data from the existing site allows for smooth data migration. Data can be exported in a standardized format and then imported into the new system, preserving data integrity and minimizing data entry efforts.

To export data, you need to click on the button:

:::info
Data for export can be generated from 15 minutes or more.

Format that will be available for download is CSV.

CSV stands for "Comma-Separated Values". It is a simple and widely used file format for storing and exchanging tabular data, where each line in the file represents a row of data, and the values within each row are separated by commas or other delimiters, such as tabs or semicolons.
