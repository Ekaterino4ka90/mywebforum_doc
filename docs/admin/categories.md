# Categories

Categories on a website are used to organize and group similar content together, making it easier for users to navigate and find what they are looking for.

Categories also help with search engine optimization (SEO) by making it easier for search engines to understand the content of the website and to index it correctly. By using clear and descriptive category names and organizing content in a logical way, website owners can improve their chances of ranking higher in search engine results pages (SERPs).

## Social Share Buttons

There are several reasons why websites often include share buttons for social networks:

- **_Increased visibility:_** Social media share buttons allow visitors to easily share content from a website on their social media profiles, which can increase the visibility of the content and the website itself.
- **_User convenience:_** Including social media share buttons makes it easier for visitors to share content they find interesting or valuable without having to copy and paste URLs or content.
- **_Social proof:_** When visitors see that others are sharing a website's content on social media, it can serve as social proof that the content is valuable or trustworthy.
- **_Increased traffic:_** When content is shared on social media, it can lead to increased traffic to the website as people click on the shared links.

To enable social media icons, move the scroll to the right:
