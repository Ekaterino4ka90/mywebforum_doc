# Redirect

There are several reasons why a website might use redirects:

**_Change of URL:_** If a website changes the URL of a particular page or moves it to a new location, they might use a redirect to ensure that users who try to access the old URL are automatically redirected to the new one.

**_Consolidating multiple pages:_** Sometimes a website might have multiple pages with similar or identical content. In this case, they might use a redirect to consolidate the pages and avoid duplicate content.

**_Changing website structure:_** If a website changes its structure, it might use redirects to ensure that users can still access the content they're looking for.

To set up a redirect, press the button:

![redirect](/img/redirect.png)

![redirect2](/img/redirect2.png)

Next, write down the "Old URL" and "New URL", and click "Save" in the right-hand corner of the screen area.
