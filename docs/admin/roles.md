# Roles

Roles on a forum are typically used to divide between users based on their level of access, permissions, and responsibilities. By assigning roles to users, forums can ensure that the community is managed effectively and that users are held accountable for their actions.

:::danger
There are three default roles installed on the platform that cannot be edited.
