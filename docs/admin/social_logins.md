# Social logins

Social logins refer toallows users to log into websites or applications using their social media account credentials instead of creating a new account or providing their email address and password.

This eliminates the need for users to remember multiple usernames and passwords and provides a more seamless and convenient user experience.

To turn it on, select which social networks you will use:

Click on the button:

After that, this function will turn on to register new users:

The same goes if the user is already registered:
