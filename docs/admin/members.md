# Members

Having a members section can provide a number of benefits to both the website or application owner and the users themselves. For website or application owners, it can help with user engagement, as users can create personalized profiles and interact with other users. It can also help with data collection and analysis, as user behavior and preferences can be tracked and analyzed.

The section provides the following information:

- **_First name:_** Specified by the user, if desired.
- **_Last name:_** Specified by the user, if desired.

- **_Trusted User:_** If the user has this status, all his messages on the forum are published immediately without moderation.
